this is DISCRETA, a package for the construction 
of combinatorial t-Designs with a prescribed 
automorphism group.

Mor information can be found on the DISCRETA homepage:
http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/betten/DISCRETA/Index.html



INSTALLATION:
=============

1) 
unpack and untar 
discreta.tar.gz
Assume we now have DISCRETA.98 as a subdirectory 
of your current directory. 

2) 

go into DISCRETA.98

3)
type
csh

4)
type:
source cshrc

5)
type:
make


6)
put a line 
source ~/DISCRETA.98/cshrc
into your .cshrc
Modify this line according to the actual place 
of DISCRETA.98 on your system.
This will allow the system to include the path 
for the discreta executables into its search path.
The path for executables 
is something like
DISCRETA.98/obj/XXX/BIN

where XXX stands for the type of your system
(=sgi, =linux, =dec, =hp, =sun etc)



7)
there is another README in 
DISCRETA.98/MAIN
