discreta:

discreta is the name of the main executable of the package.
It lives in $(DISCRETA_HOME)/obj/$(DISCRETA_ARCH)/BIN
and thus you should include this directory into your path.




design.txt:

This file contains a database of parameter sets of designs.
Call database in discreta, push "create database", then 
push "read design.txt" and the database will be created. 
All derived and residual designs and t-designs 
with respect to smaller t are created (for $t \ge 4$). 
Push "write html" and discreta will create a html version 
of the database (four files). 
The database is maintained in Bayreuth, the link is
http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/betten/DISCRETA/Index.html#database




designs.bib:

references in bibtex format for design.txt.





r0.tex:

a tex file which is needed for running the "report" function 
of DISCRETA.
You can modify this file to adapt to your local tex installation.





Here some comments for running DISCRETA:

The menu-function "choose group"  allows to compose 
a permutation group in various ways.
There is an extra dialog window opening which is 
used to compose the group.
In order to compose a group one has various possibilities 
to choose or modify the group.
DISCRETA supplies a variety of different groups 
which are parameterized in different ways.
These basic groups are selected from the 
"well-known", "linear", "sporadic" and "solvable" 
dialogs at the top of the group selection window.
The buttons in the right side of the dialog 
are used to modify existing groups. 
All selections are recorded in the listbox to the left 
and "choose" at the bottom of the dialog 
allows to create the specified group.
Files containing the generators for the chosen group 
are written into the current directory.

DISCRETA supplies generators for the following groups:

well known permutation groups (button "well known"):
=================================================

i)
Symmetric group Sn  generated by two elements

ii)
Symmetric group Sn generated by (neighboured) transpositions

iii)
Alternating groups, generated by all three-cycles

iv)
Dihedral groups, generated by two elements
(one long cycle, one involution)

v)
Cyclic groups, generated by one cycle

vi) Hol(C_n) = Holomorph of Cn: degree $n$, order $n \cdot \varphi(n)$

vii) Id_n: the trivial group on $n$ points.

viii) subgroup of $Hol(C_n)$ of index $m$: degree $n$, order $n \cdot \varphi(n)/m$, $m$ should divide $\varphi(n)$.

ix) $S_n \wr S_m$.


sporadic-groups:
===============
Mathieu 11, 12, 23, 24, 
Higman-Sims group on 176 points

linear groups (button "linear"):
==============================

"SS" is an abbreviation for $\Sigma$,
"GG" is an abbreviation for $\Gamm$,

i)
projective groups of dimension n over Galois field GF_q (q=p^f)
(s=special, i.e. det 1, 
g=general i.e. all determinants, 
Sigma=special but with field automorphisms x \mapsto x^p
Gamma= all determinants, with fiels automorphisms x \mapsto x^p
where q = p^f)
PSL PGL PSigmaL PGammaL
the degree of the projective representation is (q^n-1) / (q-1)
which is the number of one-dimensional subspaces of (GF_q)^n
The subspaces are numbered in a natuaral way, 
starting with $(0,0,\ldots,1)$  and ending with $(1,q-1,\ldots,q-1)$.

ii)
general linear groups in affine representation
SL GL SigmaL GammaL
Here the degree is q^n

iii)
affine groups 
(=general linear groups in affine representation plus translations)
ASL AGL ASigmaL AGammaL
Here the degree is q^n

iv)
PSU_3(q^2)
unitary groups on the isotropic vectors
see Huppert: Endliche Gruppen I, Springer 

v)
Sz(q)
Suzuki groups on Tits ovoid
see Huppert: Endliche Gruppen I, Springer


======================================

DISCRETA allows to read in generators for groups from a file. 
Type in the file name anfd click on "file:"

The format of generator files is simple, 
The file is format free and consists of numbers.
Example:
2 5
2 3 4 5 1 
2 1 3 4 5 
would define a symmetric group on fife points.
The first number $m$ is the number of generators, 
the second number $n$ is the degree.
Then we have $m \timdes n$ numbers listing the 
generators.
By pressing "file:", the file name will be transferred 
into the listbox. 
However, the file is not yet read in, 
this is postponed until one eventually composes the group 
with "choose".


======================================

One can type in generators by hand in cycle notation. 
entre the permutation in the text field after 
"permutation:" and push the button "permutation:". 
The permutation will be transferred into the listbox.






Back to the main window of DISCRETA:

After the choice of the group the field 'group' and 'v' in the main dialog 
will be set to the generated name of the group and the degree of the group.
The degree will be the parameter v in the design. 
The choose group dialog may be dismissed by pressing "dismiss".


searching for a design with this group as (subgroup) of automorphisms.
We need the parameters t, k and \lambda of the design.
\lambda will be important later, at first we start with 
computing the orbits of the group on t and k sets 
(t-sets = orbits of the group on the sets of cardinality t)
Note that all i-orbits are computed for i <= k.
Not also that always t < k.
Because of complementary designs 
the search is only interesting for $t < \lfloor v/2 \rfloor$.
After choosing t and k one decides to compute the representatives 
and/or the stabilizers by activating / deactivating the appropriate switches 
in the dialog. 
The one starts the computation with the button 'compute matrix'.
Watch the X-terminal for text-output !
Files containing the generators for the chosen group 
are written into the current directory.



B.2) 
One can have a look at the matrix with 'show matrix'

C)
To search a design one has to choos the appropriate parameter lambda.
Initially, there is a '1' filled into the dialog field.
One always should start with a '1' here and begin with 
pressing the button 'compute delta lambda' 
(the group has to be selected i.e. v and t and k need to be known)
In the text window one sees some additional lines of text.
Here the lowest/rightmost number (integer) is IMPORTANT:
it is the greatest common denominator which occures 
in computing the design parameters with respect to all t'<t.

>>>  Note that \lambda has to be a multiple of this denominator ! <<<

Because of complementary designs on can limit oneself with the 
search for designs with 
$\lambda <= \lfloor {v -t \choose k - t} / 2 \rfloor$
where $s= {v -t \choose k - t} $ is the row sum 
of the kramer mesner matrix (the row sum is a constant !).

D.1)
Under 'LLL parameter' one can choose parameters for the 
LLL / LLL enumeration program. 
The pre-selected parameters are fine for most cases.

D.2)
After choosing one's preferred \lambda 
One can push one of the buttons for solving the 
integer system of equations:
'LLL' starts a (complete) enumeraton of all solutions via LLL
'LLL print solutions' does the same but prints each solution (in the X-terminal)
'McKay' starts the (complete) enumeration of all solutions 
        with a backtrack program of B.D.McKay

Another remark concerning the LLL programs: 
one has to take care that the dimensions are correct. 
There are two numbers (integers) printed after the LLL-step. 
These numbers have to be checked for equality !!!.
If they are not equal one can double the first parameter 
under 'LLL parameter'

Yet another remark: 
Note that in the initial (LLL) phase of the LLL-solver 
the program prints solutions for other lambda values if it finds some. 
These can be seen as hints for choosing lambda for another computation.
